# League of Legends as a Software Engineer

`STATUS: UPDATING`

This project is to serve as a reminiscence of my once-upon-a-time favorite game
League of Legends. As I have grown older with so many other worries and duties 
in life, playing League is no longer in my head (and not mentally healthy 
either lol~). As a software engineer, this is will be a side project for me to 
keep myself connected with League but in a more mature and healthier way.

## List of Projects
TBA

## Dedication
I dedicate this hardwork commitment to my mom who has sacrificed everything for 
my future, the 16-year-old Han-Elliot who did not give up after all the pain 
she had, and all those people that have been loving me unconditionally after 
all this time, or have left behind the most positive impacts and lessons I have 
learned in life. I love you all!
